# simple_alpha_zero
A simple implementation of alpha zero with an application to the game of meta noughts and crosses.

## Current Project Plan

1. Implement a terminal version of [meta noughts and crosses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe]) with a 'dumb' opponent - i.e. one who picks the next move randomly.
2. Train a smarter opponent using a simple (think can run on a laptop) version of [Alpha Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero).
